Description: Supervised learning from a source distribution (with known segmentation into cell sub-populations) 
             to fit a target distribution with unknown segmentation. It relies regularized optimal transport to directly 
             estimate the different cell population proportions from a biological sample characterized with flow cytometry 
             measurements. It is based on the regularized Wasserstein metric to compare cytometry measurements from 
             different samples, thus accounting for possible mis-alignment of a given cell population across sample 
             (due to technical variability from the technology of measurements). Supervised learning technique based 
             on the Wasserstein metric that is used to estimate an optimal re-weighting of class proportions in a 
             mixture model Details are presented in Freulon P, Bigot J and Hejblum BP (2023) <doi:10.1214/22-AOAS1660>.
