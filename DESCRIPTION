Description: A new algorithm, referred to as CytOpT, using regularized optimal transport to directly estimate the different cell population proportions from a biological sample characterized with flow cytometry measurements. It is based on the regularized Wasserstein metric to compare cytometry measurements from different samples, thus accounting for possible mis-alignment of a given cell population across sample (due to technical variability from the technology of measurements).
