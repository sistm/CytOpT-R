# CytOpT.R

The goal of CytOpT.R is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of CytOpT.R like so:
```{r example}
install.packages("CytOpT")
## basic example code
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# Source Data
X_source <- read.csv('tests/ressources/W2_1_values.csv')
Lab_source <- read.csv('tests/ressources/W2_1_clust.csv')[, 2]

# Target Data
X_target <- read.csv('tests/ressources/W2_7_values.csv')
Lab_target <- read.csv('tests/ressources/W2_7_clust.csv')[, 2]

# The true proportions in the target data set X_source
theta_true <- rep(0,10)
for (k in 1:10) theta_true[k] <- sum(Lab_target == k)/length(Lab_target)

# comparison two methods
CytOpt(X_source, X_target, Lab_source, theta_true=theta_true, method='comparison_opt')

```
