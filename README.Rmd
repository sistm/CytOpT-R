`CytOpT` uses regularized optimal transport to directly estimate the different cell population proportions from a biological sample characterized with flow cytometry measurements.

## Overview

`CytOpT` is an `R` package that provides a new algorithm relying regularized optimal transport to directly estimate the different cell population proportions from a biological sample characterized with flow cytometry measurements. Algorithm is based on the regularized Wasserstein metric to compare cytometry measurements from different samples, thus accounting for possible mis-alignment of a given cell population across sample (due to technical variability from the technology of measurements).

The main function of the package is `CytOpT()`.

The methods implemented in this package are detailed in the following article:

> Paul Freulon, Jérémie Bigot, Boris P. Hejblum. CytOpT: Optimal Transport with Domain Adaptation for Interpreting Flow Cytometry data
> https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09003

## Installation

You can install and load `CytOpT` into `R` from 
[`CRAN`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CytOpT) with the following commands:

```{r CRAN-install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("CytOpT")
library(CytOpT)
```


Alternatively, you can install the development version of CytOpT like so:
```{r GitHub-install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("sistm/CytOpT-R")
library(CytOpT)
```


## Example

This is a basic example of `CytOpt` usage:

### Data import
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(CytOpT)
# Load source Data
data("HIPC_Stanford")
```

```{r}
# Define the true proportions in the target data set
gold_standard_manual_prop <- c(table(HIPC_Stanford_1369_1A_labels)/length(HIPC_Stanford_1369_1A_labels))
```

### Proportion estimations using *optimal transport* and *minmax swapping* procedures
```{r}
# Run CytOpt and compare the two optimization methods
res <- CytOpT(X_s = HIPC_Stanford_1228_1A, X_t = HIPC_Stanford_1369_1A, 
              Lab_source = HIPC_Stanford_1228_1A_labels,
              theta_true = gold_standard_manual_prop,
              eps = 0.0001, lbd = 0.0001, n_iter = 10000, n_stoc=10,
              step_grad = 10, step = 5, power = 0.99, 
              method='both', monitoring=TRUE)
```


```{r}
summary(res)
```


```{r summary-plots, fig.retina=2}
plot(res)
```

```{r BAplot, fig.retina=2}
Bland_Altman(res$proportions)
```
